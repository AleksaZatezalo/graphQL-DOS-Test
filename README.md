# GraphQL DOS Test
This Python script is a security testing tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in GraphQL endpoints. The core functionality revolves around testing three main types of potential attacks: alias overloading (creating multiple aliases for the same field), directive overloading (stacking multiple directives on a field), and field duplication (repeatedly requesting the same fields). The tool first attempts to perform GraphQL introspection to discover the API's schema and identify testable fields, which is a crucial first step in assessing the endpoint's security. For each discovered field, the script measures response times and checks for errors while performing stress tests with configurable iteration counts to identify potential weaknesses. The tool provides clear console output with emojis and formatting to help visualize the test results, making it useful for security researchers and developers looking to assess GraphQL endpoint security.
